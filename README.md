You want to filter out some Unicode characters (saved as an int) from your random Unicode generator, but you want to filter out unassigned Unicodes?
Then this is a horrible solution for your problem!
# Please use an official library instead of this mess.

Q: Does it filter everything correctly?
A: I'm 2% sure that it does.

Q: Is this up to date?
A: I'm 50% Sure that this is not up-to-date.

Q: why is there a terrible search algorithm?
A: I thought one might be better than none, but it's not that important for me to implement something better. It's fast enough for my uses.

Q: Why did you decide to make this?
A: Because why not?
