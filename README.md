# Compilation

I might add a Makefile somewhere in the future or document how to compile it on Linux.  
Until then, there are precompiled binaries.  

# Please use an official library instead of this mess.  

This was more for fun, and it likely is not good for actually projects, I encourage you to find a better alternative.  

Q: Does it filter everything correctly?  
A: I'm 2% sure that it does.


Q: Is this up to date?  
A: I'm 50% Sure that this is not up-to-date.


Q: why is there a terrible search algorithm?  
A: I thought one might be better than none, but it's not that important for me to implement something better. It's fast enough for my uses.


Q: Why did you decide to make this?  
A: Because why not?
